== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get a GTM Container ID? =

Create an account and container in <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a> and get it there.

= Is Google Analytics 4 (GA4) supported? =

Yes! We strive to support the full feature set of Google Analytics 4 and will implement any future features of Analytics 4.

= Is Google Universal Analytics supported? =

Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics) properties will stop collecting data starting July 1, 2023. GTM Kit does not support Enhanced ecommerce with Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics).

Yes! Pagespeed is one of our main focus points, and we strive to make the plugin compatible with full page caching.
