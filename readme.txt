Flexible tool for generating the data layer for Google Tag Manager. Including WooCommerce data for Google Analytics 4 and support for server side GTM.

== Description ==

The goal of GTM Kit is to provide a flexible tool for generating the data layer for Google Tag Manager. Including WooCommerce data for Google Analytics 4.

## Flexible container implementation

Depending on how you use Google Tag Manager you can delay the loading of the container script until the browser is idle. You can furthermore extend te delay with a timer. This may be relevant to you be if are focusing on pagespeed.

You may enter a custom domain name if you are using a custom server side GTM (sGTM) container for tracking. It's also possible to specify a custom loader.

## Post data

You may specify which post data elements you wish to include in the dataLayer for use in Google Tag Manager.
- Post type: include the type of the current post or archive page.
- Categories: include the categories of the current post or archive page.
- Tags: include the tags of the current post or archive page.
- Post title: include the post title of the current post.
- Post ID: include the Post ID of the current post.
- Post date: include the post date.
- Post author name: include the post author name.
- Post author ID: include the post author ID.

## eCommerce events tracked with Google Analytics 4

When the WooCommerce integration is activated the following GA4 events are automatically included in the dataLayer:

- view_item_list
- select_item
- view_item
- add_to_cart
- view_cart
- remove_from_cart
- begin_checkout
- add_shipping_info
- add_payment_info
- purchase

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get a GTM Container ID? =

Create an account and container in <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a> and get it there.

= Is Google Analytics 4 (GA4) supported? =

Yes! We strive to support the full feature set of Google Analytics 4 and will implement any future features of Analytics 4.

= Is Google Universal Analytics supported? =

Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics) properties will stop collecting data starting July 1, 2023. GTM Kit does not support Enhanced ecommerce with Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics).
