Google Tag Manager and GA4 integration. Including WooCommerce data for Google Analytics 4 and support for server side GTM.

== Description ==

GTM Kit puts the Google Tag Manager container code on your website so that you don't need to touch any code. It also pushes data from WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and Contact Form 7 to the data layer for use with for Google Analytics 4, Facebook and other GTM tags.

The goal of GTM Kit is to provide a flexible tool for generating the data layer for Google Tag Manager. It is easy to use and doesn't require any coding, but it allows developers to customize the plugin as needed.
